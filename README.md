## Rest API

### User

"Users" represent end users of the app. Users can additionally have a role which will determine authorization level in the app.

- `GET /users`: List users of the app.

- `GET /users/email`: Find a specific user by email.

  Use as `GET /users/email?email=paul.anderson@magnolia.com`.

- `GET /users/email/:id`: Fetch a user by ID.

- `POST /users`: Create a new user.

  The body should contain the following fields:

  ```json
  {
    "name": "Paul Anderson",
    "email": "paul.anderson@magnolia.com",
    "avatar": "http://www.example.com/some.jpg"
  }
  ```

- `PUT /users/:id`: Update an existing user.

  The fields that can be updated include:

  ```json
